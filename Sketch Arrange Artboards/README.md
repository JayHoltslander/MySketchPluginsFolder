# Arrange Artboard plugin for Sketch

Managing artboards can get messy, especially when you insert artboards in the middle of a sequence.
The Arrange Artboard plugin lays out all your artboards in a grid with user-specified number of rows.


Works great in conjuction with these plugins:
 - [Numberize](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands/tree/master/Numberize)
 - [Next /Previous Artboard](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-plugins-1)
