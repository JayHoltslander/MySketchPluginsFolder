# Better Paste plugin for Sketch
Paste like it was meant to be--into the artboard you're viewing.

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8F6gtfnwpc) to see how broken pasting is in Sketch.

Press Ctrl+V and Better Paste determines which area of which artboard 
is centered in your view and pastes right there, not some at some random
area or artboard far away.

PRO TIP: Go into System Preferences for Keyboard Shortcuts and reassign the native Cmd+V combo to activate Better Paste.
