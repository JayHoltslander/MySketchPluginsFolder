# Sketch Commands

Sketch Commands is a port of some of my [Orange Commands for Fireworks](http://orangecommands.com) for Bohemian Coding’s [Sketch.app](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

It works both with the App Store and the non-sandboxed versions of Sketch (i.e: the beta).


## Installation

1. [Download the ZIP file with the commands](https://github.com/bomberstudios/sketch-commands/zipball/master)
2. Copy the contents of the ZIP to your plugins folder. If you're using Sketch 3, choose **Plugins › Reveal Plugins Folder…** to open it. If you're using Sketch 2, choose **Plugins › Custom Script…**, click the gear icon, and then choose **Open Plugins Folder**.

## More info

If you are curious about scripting Sketch, here's a link to the official [Sketch Scripting API documentation](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/developer/).


## Thanks

Huge props to Bohemian Coding (and specially Pieter Omvlee) for their collaboration on making the scripting API a reality.
